# Resume-Scoring-using-NLP
The objective of the project is to create a Resume Scoring algorithm using Natural Language Processing. The algorithm will parse resumes one by one and will create a Candidate Profile based on the skills mentioned in the resume. A corpus is created using Sketch Engine, Wikipedia pages for various required skills (example : Machine Learning, Data Science, Software developer, Programming) are given as input, Sketch Engine creates a corpus from the useful data available on the given links. Word Embeddings are created from the corpus and these are used to match the skills in the candidate resume with the required skills. Finally, the candidate profile is built and plotted as a bar graph for better visualization.
